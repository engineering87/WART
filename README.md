WART is a C# .NET library that enables you to extend any Web API controller and forward incoming calls directly to a SignalR hub. This hub then broadcasts notifications containing detailed information about the calls, including both the request and the response. Additionally, WART supports JWT authentication for secure communication with SignalR.

## Features
- Converts REST API calls into SignalR events, enabling real-time communication.
- Provides controllers (`WartController`, `WartControllerJwt`) for automatic SignalR event broadcasting.
- Supports JWT authentication for SignalR hub connections.
- Allows API exclusion from event broadcasting with `[ExcludeWart]` attribute.
- Enables group-specific event dispatching with `[GroupWart("group_name")]`.
- Configurable middleware (`AddWartMiddleware`) for flexible integration.

## Installation
You can install the library via the NuGet package manager with the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package WART-Core
```

### How it works
WART implements a custom controller which overrides the `OnActionExecuting` and `OnActionExecuted` methods to retrieve the request and the response and encapsulates them in a **WartEvent** object which will be sent via SignalR on the **WartHub**.

### How to use it

To use the WART library, each WebApi controller must extend the **WartController** controller:

```csharp
using WART_Core.Controllers;
using WART_Core.Hubs;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class TestController : WartController
```

each controller must implement the following constructor, for example:

```csharp
public TestController(IHubContext<WartHub> messageHubContext, 
ILogger<WartController> logger) : base(messageHubContext, logger)
{
}
```

WART support JWT bearer authentication on SignalR hub, if you want to use JWT authentication use the following controller extension:

```csharp
using WART_Core.Controllers;
using WART_Core.Hubs;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class TestController : WartControllerJwt
```

You also need to enable SignalR in the WebAPI solution and map the **WartHub**.
To do this, add the following configurations in the Startup.cs class:

```csharp
using WART_Core.Middleware;
```

In the ConfigureServices section add following:

```csharp
services.AddWartMiddleware();
```

or by specifying JWT authentication:


```csharp
services.AddWartMiddleware(hubType:HubType.JwtAuthentication, tokenKey:"password_here");
```

In the Configure section add the following:

```csharp
app.UseWartMiddleware();
```

or by specifying JWT authentication:

```csharp
app.UseWartMiddleware(HubType.JwtAuthentication);
```

Alternatively, it is possible to specify a custom hub name:

```csharp
app.UseWartMiddleware("hubname");
```

at this point it will be sufficient to connect via SignalR to the WartHub to receive notifications in real time of any call on the controller endpoints. 
For example:

```csharp
var hubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder()
    .WithUrl("http://localhost:52086/warthub")
    .Build();
    
hubConnection.On<string>("Send", (data) =>
{
  // data is the WartEvent JSON
});
```

or with JWT authentication:

```csharp
var hubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder()
    .WithUrl($"http://localhost:51392/warthub", options =>
    {
        options.SkipNegotiation = true;
        options.Transports = HttpTransportType.WebSockets;
        options.AccessTokenProvider = () => Task.FromResult(GenerateToken());
    })
    .WithAutomaticReconnect()
    .Build();
    
hubConnection.On<string>("Send", (data) =>
{
  // data is the WartEvent JSON
});
```

In the source code you can find a simple test client and WebApi project.

### Excluding APIs from Event Propagation
There might be scenarios where you want to exclude specific APIs from propagating events to connected clients. This can be particularly useful when certain endpoints should not trigger updates, notifications, or other real-time messages through SignalR. To achieve this, you can use a custom filter called `ExcludeWartAttribute`. By decorating the desired API endpoints with this attribute, you can prevent them from being included in the SignalR event propagation logic, for example:

```csharp
[HttpGet("{id}")]
[ExcludeWart]
public ActionResult<TestEntity> Get(int id)
{
    var item = Items.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Id == id);
    if (item == null)
    {
        return NotFound();
    }
    return item;
}
```

### SignalR Event Dispatching for Specific Groups
WART enables sending API events to specific groups in SignalR by specifying the group name in the query string. This approach allows for flexible and targeted event broadcasting, ensuring that only the intended group of clients receives the event. 
By decorating an API method with `[GroupWart("group_name")]`, it is possible to specify the SignalR group name to which the dispatch of specific events for that API is restricted. This ensures that only the clients subscribed to the specified group ("SampleGroupName") will receive the related events, allowing for targeted, group-based communication in a SignalR environment.

```csharp
[HttpPost]
[GroupWart("SampleGroupName")]
public ActionResult<TestEntity> Post([FromBody] TestEntity entity)
{
    Items.Add(entity);
    return entity;
}
```

By appending `?WartGroup=group_name` to the URL, the library enables dispatching events from individual APIs to a specific SignalR group, identified by `group_name`. This allows for granular control over which clients receive the event, leveraging SignalRâ€™s built-in group functionality.
